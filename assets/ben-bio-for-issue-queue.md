I'll start! My name is Ben Miller, and I'm an assistant professor in the Composition program of the English department, where in addition to Composing Digital Media I've taught Composition Studies, Writing with Style, and Writing with Data, plus a bunch of sections of Seminar in Composition. This is my (yikes) seventh year at Pitt.

I recently co-edited an academic collection on Composition and Big Data, and I'm a founding editor of the [Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy](http://jitpedagogy.org), where I'm often called upon to edit both CSS stylesheets and articles-in-progress. My book *[Distant Readings of Disciplinarity: Knowing and Doing in Composition-Rhetoric Dissertations](https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/6234-distant-readings-of-disciplinarity)* just came out last month from Utah State University Press. I'm still pretty psyched!

There's more, but maybe that's enough for now! I'm very much looking forward to this semester: I've thought a lot about where it might go, but I've taught enough by now to realize that it's all going to change when we get into it together. I can't wait to see where we end up!
