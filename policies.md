## Attendance
This class meets only once a week, and several of those weeks include holidays that mean we will not meet as a group at all. In a small seminar such as this one, the loss of even a single member of the class can have a major impact on the work we're able to do and the insights we're able to reach. I therefore expect everyone to be present whenever class is in session.

That said, I know life is complex, and we have a lot going on – including conferences, illnesses, families, and other legitimate claims on our time and energy. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend, please let me know and we can try to arrange an alternative form of participation. If you must be absent unexpectedly, please try to reach out to me and your classmates as soon as you're able. It won't be the same as if you were here, but something may yet be gleaned as we try to catch you up.

## Inclusion and Access
I strive to set you up for success. If there are circumstances that may affect your performance in this class, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can work together to develop strategies for succeeding, which might include adapting assignments to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Office of Disability Resources and Services, 140 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890 / 412-624-3346 (Fax), as early as possible in the term. Disability Resources and Services will verify your disability and help determine reasonable accommodations for this course. For more information, visit [www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drsabout](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drsabout).

I also ask that everyone in the class strive to help ensure that everyone can learn in a supportive and respectful environment, including [gender-inclusive language](https://www.gsws.pitt.edu/resources/faculty-resources/gender-inclusivenon-sexist-language-statement-syllabi).

For my part, I will work to ensure multiple ways of accessing class materials, including written lesson plans in screen-reader compliant html, alternative text for images, and transcriptions for recorded videos. Because proofreading the latter is particularly time-consuming, I ask that you please [let me know](mailto:millerb@pitt.edu) if you will be relying on transcriptions.

While we're on the subject of email, I am obligated to include the standard statement on using your University-issued email address:
<details><summary>Click to expand.</summary>

<p>Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username@pitt.edu) upon admittance. This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication with students. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications.</p>
<p>The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e- mail via other service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address. To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to <a href="http://accounts.pitt.edu">http://accounts.pitt.edu</a>, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full E-mail Communication Policy, go to <a href="https://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html">www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html</a>.)</p>

## Avoiding Plagiarism

This is a collaborative class, in which we offer each other suggestions and constructive criticism. However, the goal of all this collaboration is to clarify the expression of original ideas – never to substitute someone else's ideas for our own, or to impose our ideas on someone else.
To misrepresent the origins of an idea is plagiarism, and it is a problem both for your own learning and for the well-being of the community, which depends on mutual trust.
If you want to incorporate materials that others have created, you can do so if you give credit to your source. At a minimum, readers of your work should be able to get back to the original, so be sure to provide at least the author's identity; the original title; the publication venue; the date of publication and/or access; and a URL if appropriate. The English department has some useful resources at <a href="https://www.english.pitt.edu/undergraduate/plagiarism">www.english.pitt.edu/undergraduate/plagiarism</a>.

(And if you want to collaborate with an AI, there are ways to do so without sacrificing your learning. [See below](#artificial-intelligence) for starters, but let’s talk!)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, because Pitt takes a very hard stance on plagiarism. It could get you expelled. Here's an excerpt from the official Policy on Academic Integrity, to give you the flavor:

<blockquote>
    <p>Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.</p>

    <p>A student has an obligation to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the profession in carrying out his or her academic assignments.  Without limiting the application of this principle, a student may be found to have violated this obligation if he or she: […]<ol start="8">
        <!--8--><li>Depends on the aid of others in a manner expressly prohibited by the faculty member, in the research, preparation, creation, writing, performing, or publication of work to be submitted for academic credit or evaluation.</li>
        <!--9--><li>Provides aid to another person, knowing such aid is expressly prohibited by the faculty member, in the research, preparation, creation, writing, performing, or publication of work to be submitted for academic credit or evaluation.</li>
        <!--10--><li>Presents as one's own, for academic evaluation, the ideas, representations, or words of another person or persons without customary and proper acknowledgment of sources.</li>
        <!--11--><li>Submits the work of another person in a manner which represents the work to be one's own.</li>
        <!--12--><li>Knowingly permits one's work to be submitted by another person without the faculty member's authorization.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</blockquote>

You have the right to a fair hearing, and I’ll talk to you before I talk to anyone else, but it’s far easier just to avoid plagiarism in the first place. All clear cases of deliberate plagiarism will be referred to the appropriate Dean for disciplinary action, including an Academic Integrity Board hearing. For the University's full policy on Academic Integrity and the adjudication process for infringements, including plagiarism, go to <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~provost/ai1.html">http://www.pitt.edu/~provost/ai1.html</a>.


## On Artificial Intelligence

In this class, you are responsible for the integrity and accuracy of anything you turn in; if you draw on an outside source, I expect you to provide a citation that would allow me and other readers to return to that source and understand its context. Note that so far, I haven't said anything specific to AI: this is just a standard statement about academic honesty and courtesy.

In the case of a generative AI, including both large language models (LLMs) like GPT/ChatGPT, BERT, or Sudowrite and image generators like Stable Diffusion or Dall-E, an element of randomness means we can't go back directly to the original and see the same thing you saw. Even so, the knowledge that you consulted such a model as part of your process adds important context to your work, much as a citation does, and our understanding of that context is further improved if you can share the prompt you submitted. (In some cases, it may even make sense to save the transcript, e.g. to make it available as an appendix or upon request.)

I do not believe LLMs spell the end of writing as part of education – for one thing, the epistemic process of trying to figure out what you mean by trying to put it in language is often the greatest benefit of writing in the first place (see [Perl](https://compcomm.commons.gc.cuny.edu/feltsense/part-one-what-is-felt-sense/ "Perl, Sondra. Felt Sense: Writing with the Body. Boynton/Cook, 2004."); [Vee](https://compositionstudiesjournal.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/vee.pdf "Vee, Annette. “Large Language Models Write Answers.” Composition Studies, vol. 51, no. 1, Spring 2023, pp. 176–81.")), and LLMs' outputs aren't designed for that kind of learning. Working to find the right prompt, though, has some potential for writing-to-learn, and so does figuring out what _doesn't_ work for you in an LLM-generated response. These are still early days, and AI-assisted writing isn't going away; rather, how to learn and teach writing alongside AI is an open question that I'm genuinely curious about.

Therefore, I will allow AI-assisted submissions in this class, provided that you agree to the following:

1. Along with your submission, you will acknowledge and name the AI tool you used, and describe what you used it for. If you are copying text or an image directly from the model's output, include the text of your prompt in an appendix or footnote.

2. Whenever possible, you will avoid the temptation to accept a single default output, instead requesting multiple responses from the model and selecting or remixing among them. This will require you to draw on your own discernment and allow you to write reflectively about your choices.

3. You must recognize that LLMs are not search engines: they hallucinate and fabricate citation-like structures without regard to their actual existence – even when they come attached to hyperlinks. Any references, as well as article or book summaries, should be checked for accuracy.

4. The work you submit is ultimately your responsibility, and should serve your goals in light of your understanding of your task and your audience. Therefore, you should review and edit any AI-generated output to ensure you feel satisfied that it represents your views, your voice, and your learning goals.

I'm also happy to talk more about any of this!

## Feedback, Assessment, and Grades
_Much of the language below is adapted from Alison Langmead's 2022 fall syllabus for DSAM 3000, if not the particular scholarly conversation I situate it within._

As composition theorist Peter Elbow has written in a number of places (see especially his [“Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378503 "Elbow, Peter. “Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking: Sorting out Three Forms of Judgment.” College English, vol. 55, no. 2, Feb. 1993, pp. 187–206.")), grades are a surprisingly crude way of measuring or producing learning: they reduce complex phenomena to a single letter or number, and thus obscure the differences between, say, public speaking skills and ability to support an argument. Some teachers might try to get around this by assigning percentages of their grades to particular skill-sets, but I find I can’t know, in advance, what any one of you will need to work on: I want us to be free to give more targeted feedback, and set more targeted goals, than any pre-set percentage allows us to do. As I see it, each of you is here to do more than you could before, not be better than anyone else. Grades distract from that, and distract from the particular reactions and suggestions that can help you improve and grow.

Assessment, though, is different from grading. Throughout the semester, you will be assessing your own work, through your [Mindful Practice Journals](projects#mindful-practice-journal) and reflections; you will be offering feedback to each other at presentation time and in conversation; and I will be offering my own formative guidance, based on years in the profession, as you iteratively develop your projects. You will not be lacking in moments of evaluation, even as you will not have specific grades ranking your success on any given project against some putative norm.

Nevertheless, at the end of the term, I will be required to submit letter grades to the Registrar. So, **at the end of term, I will ask _you_ to select the grade that you will receive in this seminar.** While I am required to reserve the right to change these grades as appropriate, I will not do so.

I am more than happy to talk through what it means to produce a self-assessment with each of you individually or together as a group, but given that this request is not (yet) widespread in academia, I also feel that it is important to offer some written guidance on this process for you here so that you can refer to it on your own time.

I have requested specific types of course engagement and deliverables from you. These have all carefully been designed to guide you through the process of learning what it means to use digital computers mindfully in the context of the humanities and allied social sciences. In a way, my work requests aspire to be tools for learning in and of themselves, and can serve as signposts of worthwhile engagement. I have offered some metacognitive questions below to help you think through how the work of this course forms a coherent pedagogical point of view and structures for you to inhabit.

You can be confident that you are successfully working through this seminar by:

* Completing the iterations as described in the course plan, and on the schedule recommended.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: _Why is completion important? Why is the schedule important? Why can I not be "answering my question" and still succeeding in the context of this seminar?_
* Offering cogent and professional presentations that stay within the requested time limit.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: _Why is professionalism important? Why is the time limit important?_
* Offering a content-rich, web-based palimpsest that you are proud to share with others.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: _Why pride? Why do we share our findings publicly at this point in our (different) careers?_
* Writing two peer evaluations after each iteration is due.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: _Why are these evaluations requested? How can I help someone else improve when I am still so unsure of what I am doing? How can evaluating someone else help me improve?_
* Working at least 2-4 hours on your project every week, and documenting this effort in your Mindful Practice Journal.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: _Why is consistency important? Why is so much self-reflection a part of this seminar?_
* Engaging productively with the community in our weekly conversations, whether in class or in any other manner that you deem fit.
    - Example questions you might ask yourself in conversation about this task: _What is the purpose of seminar conversation? How do we learn from it? How do we balance speaking up, sitting back, and listening to produce the most effective learning environment for ourselves?_

Insofar as grades have always been a part of your educational experience, you may have strong feelings about what they have meant to you over the years, and what they might mean to you still. In the context of this seminar, I ask that we separate the practice of offering insightful, engaged feedback (which is essential to the learning process) from summative ranking (which is not), and tightly focus on what it takes to produce meaningful intellectual change over time rather than striving toward/against standards of normative success.
