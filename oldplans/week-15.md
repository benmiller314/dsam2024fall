## Preamble: An end is a beginning

I cannot believe it's already the final presentation, and our final class meeting!

But it is not *quite* the end of the semester: you still have time to reflect on your learning in the class, and add any final-_for-now_ polish to the public-facing homes of your projects. I fully believe you should be proud of what you've accomplished, even if it wasn't exactly what you set out to achieve at the beginning. I've budgeted some time at the end of class to talk through what those final reflections might look like.

Nor is it the end of DSAM: those who want to are invited to register for DSAM 3100: Practicum. (Quick show of hands, who's already registered?) As was foretold, we have here with us the professors of that course, Drs. Alison Langmead and Aaron Brenner. I've invited them to give the first brief presentation of the day, on what the Practicum looks like, so you can get a sense of how it might help you build on or break from the work you've been doing here.

Thanks!


### Workshop cycle

As with previous presentations, I am assigning you two peers to pay particular attention to, so you can lead and/or synthesize the sayback and response; and, like last time, one of your partners will be the same as last time. The other person will be someone you first led response to back in iteration one. In other words, I've tried to set this up so you'll have the perspective to notice both the continuities and the leaps these projects have taken.

And I've again split presentations in two sets of three, with peer reviews crossing from one set to the other, so you can pay extra attention to your assigned partner without having to worry that your own presentation is imminent. And I've once again rotated, so everyone has the joy of going first in the trio.

To wit:

| This person | Presenting in slot | Leads response to... | And also to... |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Reza        | 1                  | Sidra                | Khusbhoo       |
| Chloe       | 2                  | Khushboo             | Mustafa        |
| Alex        | 3                  | Mustafa              | Sidra          |
| Mustafa     | 4                  | Alex                 | Reza           |
| Sidra       | 5                  | Reza                 | Chloe          |
| Khushboo    | 6                  | Chloe                | Alex           |

<details><summary>A reminder of how you can offer feedback even while you're still figuring stuff out for yourself (hint: by being a genuine, curious audience)</summary>
<ul>
    <li>Help them see how their work is coming across to you by summarizing back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing. (That last is often a good place to lean into.)</li>
    <li>Help them see how you've tried to engage with the project through its public-facing platform, and what it makes you think of: as in my suggestions for conversation above, this may include tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects; and so on.</li>
    <li>Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.</li>
</ul>

## How to wrap up a semester?

We've done a fair amount of reflective writing this semester: in-class warm-ups and grok-writing, Mindful Practice Journals, studio plans and (at least sometimes) exit notes. I've also posed reflective questions to you in various ways, including in lesson plans like last week's and all the way back to the [syllabus](../uploads/2241%20Benjamin%20Miller%20DSAM%203000%20Seminar%20in%20Digital%20Studies%20and%20Methods%20Fall%202023.docx): see especially page 10.

Here at the end of the term, I'm asking you to _go back through it and see what it teaches you to read it all in one fell swoop_. And then to name what that process – like the process of moving through this whole course – has helped you learn.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Your final assignment is to compose a message, as a letter or a video, addressing the following questions. Your audience is at least two-fold: me (Ben) and your own future self.
</div>

1. What **methods and workflows** have worked for you (perhaps as compared to those that have not)? What were the challenges and the joys that keep you moving through them?

2. What surprised you, or what **surprises** you now as you look back? e.g. What things did you learn that you did not expect to learn, or not learn that you had expected to? What realizations or questions do those surprises point you toward?

3. What **feedback** has been most helpful to you, and how did you receive it? What have you done as a result of that feedback? Did *giving* feedback help you as well? In what ways?

4. Thinking about the **digital tools and digital objects** of study you encountered this semester, are there any you want to explore further? What are your plans for doing so?

5. Finally, how would you assess **your overall performance** in the class? Especially after considering those questions in the syllabus (see also below, for convenience), would you say you met the course's challenges and invitations at least to a baseline level of participation? (For grad school, that might be an A-minus.) Achieved some aspirational goals beyond baseline (A)? Missed in some areas but still turned in a solid performance otherwise (B+)?

<details><summary>From the syllabus: You can be confident that you are successfully working through this seminar by...</summary>
<ul>
 <li>Completing the iterations as described in the course plan, and on the schedule recommended.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: <em>Why is completion important? Why is the schedule important? Why can I not be “answering my question” and still succeeding in the context of this seminar?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Offering cogent and professional presentations that stay within the requested time limit.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: <em>Why is professionalism important? Why is the time limit important?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Offering a content-rich, web-based palimpsest that you are proud to share with others.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: <em>Why pride? Why do we share our findings publicly at this point in our (different) careers?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Writing two peer evaluations after each iteration is due.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: <em>Why are these evaluations requested? How can I help someone else improve when I am still so unsure of what I am doing? How can evaluating someone else help me improve?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Working at least 2-4 hours on your project every week, and documenting this effort in your Mindful Practice Journal.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself about this task: <em>Why is consistency important? Why is so much self-reflection a part of this seminar?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Engaging productively with the community in our weekly conversations, whether in class or in any other manner that you deem fit.<ul>
     <li>Example questions you might ask yourself in conversation about this task: <em>What is the purpose of seminar conversation? How do we learn from it? How do we balance speaking up, sitting back, and listening to produce the most effective learning environment for ourselves?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
</ul>
</details>


I'm happy to talk more about how to make these self-assessments as meaningful as possible for your learning – as ways to benchmark your own intellectual engagements, successes, and changes – rather than as tools for competitive ranking (not helpful) or enforcing normative success (there are multiple ways to succeed). Hit me up in [office hours](../office) or by email.

## Homework for next time

On the final discussion forum for the semester, please **post** the following by Wednesday, December 13 at 2pm:

1. A link to the final-for-now version of your **public-facing project**
    - As we discussed back at the previous iteration, please be sure to _give credit to sources_ you used within your public-facing site, e.g. by linking back to originals or by having a page within the project with more complete bibliographic information (title, author, location, license).
    - Note that you should also _credit yourself_! If your name and a brief bio do not yet exist on your public-facing site, consider: you use information about site creators to gauge your trust levels, right? Help others to trust you, too. : )
2. If relevant, a link to a **repository** of source materials that you have been shaping or processing to produce your project.
    - NB: Both GitHub or OneDrive offer functionality to share a folder, either publicly or with specific people. If you have a repo and aren't sure how to share it, I can help.
3. As much of your end-of-semester **reflection** (see above) as you're willing to share publicly

<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: If you do not feel comfortable sharing the repo or reflection with the public, please submit them instead by email.
</div>

---

We'll be in touch, but let me say here while we're all still gathered together: It's been a pleasure getting to know you and to work and think with you this semester. Please don't hesitate to reach out to continue that process! Thank you all!
