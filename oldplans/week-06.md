## Preamble: Workshop + peer review plan

Welcome back, and welcome to our first day of presentations! I'm excited to hear more about how it's been going, and especially for you all to hear how it's been going for everyone else.

### A workshop cycle

Here's how I'd like it to work. Each person's project will get about 15-20 minutes:

1. The first five minutes will be a live version of the **presentation** you've pre-recorded.
2. From there, the rest of us start by **saying back** what we see as the main questions or hypotheses being explored in the project, but with a twist: we'll add a **...?** to the end, opening a space for the presenter to say more.
    - This kind of _active listening_ can often get us to the edge of our current thinking, testing out the almost-said implications of what feels right and what feels off. I can start us off after the first presention, to demonstrate what I mean.
3. That should set up a more organic back-and-forth **conversation** about the project. Anything is fair game here: tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process (including questions about sources, processing, or presentation platforms); comparisons with your own projects; etc.
4. At the 15-minute mark, we'll look for a stopping point and then take some quick private **notes**: what do we want to remember for our own future projects or presentations?  for our written peer review?

### Peer review guidelines
About that peer review: you'll each be responsible for **writing back to two of your classmates**. In those reviews, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

You may be wondering, "How am I supposed to offer feedback when I'm still figuring so much out myself?" Well, in part, by being a genuine audience for your classmates:

* Help them see how their work is coming across to you by summarizing back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or _almost_ doing. (That last is often a good place to lean into.)

* Help them see how you've tried to engage with the project through its public-facing platform, and what it makes you think of: as in my suggestions for conversation above, this may include tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects; and so on.

* Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

I've split presentations in two sets of three, with peer reviews crossing from one set to the  the other. That way, you can pay extra attention to your assigned partner without having to worry that your own presentation is imminent.

The order started out alphabetical by last name; then I tweaked it so that film studies people write to each other, comp/rhet people write to each other, and Chloe doesn't have the final slot, since I know she has time pressure at the end of class. ; )

<a id="first-half"></a>
## Presentations: first half

* Sidra
* Khusboo
* Mustafa

That process, again: (1) presentation, (2) saying back…?, (3)&nbsp;conversation, (4)&nbsp;writing notes (while the next person sets up).


## Break (10 minutes)
We should hit the break at around 10:10 today.

<a id="second-half"></a>
## Presentations: second half

* Chloe
* Alex
* Reza

That process, one more time: (1) presentation, (2) saying back…?, (3)&nbsp;conversation, (4)&nbsp;writing notes (while the next person sets up).



<a id="peer-review"></a>
## Follow-ups to the project discussions

* If you haven't yet posted a link to a public-facing deliverable, please do so ASAP: even if it's just the text of your presentation (I saw that several of you had scripts) or a folder with a CSV dataset and a README file, that will be helpful for your peer reviewers – and for your own later reflection.
    - I'd be happy to help you create a fresh GitHub repo if you need one.

* If time and interest allows,


## ~~Writing time: Work toward peer review letters (until 11:45)~~ Discussion: organizing data, working with metadata

(Instead of spending the last 20 minutes of class silently, I made a call to talk more about nuts and bolts: how and why to add metadata fields in Scalar, strategies for organizing information *as data* for later examination. I also gave a verbal overview of the homework readings and how they transition us from practice with coding to practice with data.)


<a id="hw"></a>
## Homework for next time

<details open><summary>If you didn't finish writing in response to your peers, please do so as soon as possible.</summary><p>See the <a href="#peer-review-guidelines">notes above</a> for how I'm hoping these will work, but in brief:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have a look through the public-facing version of the project.</li>
        <li>Be a genuine and generous audience: help your partner see their work through your eyes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can post these notes as replies to the <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a> posts containing the videos and links to projects.</p>
    </details>

<!-- NOTE FOR NEXT TIME: This chapter contains six exercises and three free projects. For the first five exercises, create separate files using the naming convention ch7-ex1.py, iterating the number appropriately. Save these to your fork of the dsam-montfort repository. Then choose one of the free exercises (though you can do more if you like), and save that using a similar naming convention, swapping 'ex' for 'free'. Save and commit as you go, and push your files to the cloud when you're done. (Exercise 7-6 is optional, and something we can discuss alongside the other readings.) -->

Finally, please **write**: as usual, you'll find a [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions) for your 100-ish-word responses (excitements, incitements, enticements), which I'll look at while I prepare next week's lesson plan. Pointing us to a particular place in one of the readings (or videos) will be the most helpful, I expect. And if you were able to get them up by Friday (and I know it's not always possible), that's always ideal.

P.S. If you have missed posting in the past, please do add your voice to the forum from here on in? :¬)
