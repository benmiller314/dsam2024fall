## First half: Discussion

### Warm-up writing
Of the choose-your-own readings (classroom [assignments](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/ai-literacy/) [engaging](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/creative-explorations/) [with](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/ethical-considerations/) [generative](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/professional-writing/) [text](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/rhetorical-engagements/); ["where we are"](https://compstudiesjournal.com/current-issue-spring-2023-51-1/#:~:text=where%20we%20are) regarding LLMs and writing), which did you find most valuable? Why?

Which did you find most surprising or thought-provoking? (These may be the same as the above, or may not.) Why?

Be ready to briefly introduce the text to your classmates.


### Let's talk!

If we get to grok-writing by around 10:15, that should give us about equal time to dig into ideas now and then to dig into process in the second half.

And maybe we can take some collaborative notes at [bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes)?

<details><summary>Some possible passages for consideration / moments to revisit, as needed:</summary>
<ol class="spaced">
    <li><details><summary>"Writing, in other words, is thinking"</summary>
        <blockquote>Amid the ballistic calculations, Turing speculated on a prompt from his teacher, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: Can machines think? Both men thought it was a ridiculous question—Wittgenstein because he thought machines were nothing like humans and Turing because he wasn't even sure we knew what humans thought. But, Turing argued that if a machine could fool a human into thinking it was a human, then it could be said to think. The machine—a computer—would naturally use writing for this deception. Writing, in other words, is thinking—and the automation of writing is machine thinking. (Laquintano, Schnitzler, and Vee)</blockquote>
        <p>We should interrogate this. To what extent do we agree now that a computer's "natural" mode of demonstrating thought will be through written language? What are some alternatives?</p>
        </details>
    </li>
    <li><details><summary>"Writing outside the university is often transactional"</summary>
        <blockquote>To some extent, we have a gap in values and practices between writing in higher education and writing in workplace/civic/personal spheres. Many of us value that gap, but we also observe that it can devalue our work in higher education, as we are accused of not preparing students for the writing they will “actually” do. We need to address the question of whether these tools open a much wider rift between the writing we do in higher education and writing in the wider world. Writing outside the university is often transactional. While McKee and Porter (2020) rightly point out that AI writing hides or ignores the social and rhetorical contexts of writing to favor an information-transmission model of communication, many writing contexts <em>are</em> satisfied well enough with this stripped-down model of communication. Will a potential misalignment between writing inside and outside of higher ed further devalue the writing for critical inquiry that we assign and practice? (Laquintano, Schnitzler, and Vee)</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Undocumented people, immigrants, and people of color in lower-income spaces also tend to be over-surveilled. In other words, they’re more likely to have data and information collected about them with- out their consent, or they’re forced to give it up to get access to basic needs. For example, if you qualify for food stamps in the US, you know that you had to share a lot of information about yourself with the local government, whereas your wealthier neighbor likely hasn’t been forced to in the same way.</p>
            <p>This overcollection of data <em>about</em> some people and undercollection of data that <em>serves</em> those people results in a cycle of data violence that is passed on to these algorithms.</p>

    <li><details><summary>When the frustration is part of the point</summary>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If you were able to come up with a social algorithm that can determine who is interesting and fun in an equitable way... amazing! <strong>We suspect that you may have stopped at some point and questioned the activity.</strong> Maybe you thought that there was no good way of telling how fun or interesting someone is. Or maybe you considered that ideas of “fun” and “interesting” are contextual, and might be different for different people. Maybe you just designed an algorithm that would make it so you could attend the party!</p>
            <p>This activity is meant to show just how complex humans are and how attributes like “interesting” and “fun” are relative to whoever is designing the algorithm. (Onuoha and Mother Cyborg 41, emphasis added)</p>

        <blockquote>On one hand, removing these problematic datasets from the internet may seem like a victory. The most obvious privacy and ethical violations are addressed by making them no longer accessible. However, taking them offline doesn’t stop their work in the world: these training sets have been downloaded countless times, and have made their way into many production AI systems and academic papers. By erasing them completely, not only is a significant part of the history of AI lost, but researchers are unable to see how the assumptions, labels, and classificatory approaches have been replicated in new systems, or trace the provenance of skews and biases exhibited in working systems.

### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?</p>
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which we'll all say, simply, "thank you."

<a href="week-03#an-explanation" class="smaller" title="We skipped this explanation in week 3, but it's there if you're curious">Why this terminology?</a>


## Break (10 minutes)
Assuming we left off at 10:30, let's aim to start up again at 10:40 or so. That should beat the elevator rush for 11am classes.

## Second half: Hands on

Before studio, some announcements and some writing prompts.

### Guests next week
Drs. [Alison Langmead](https://www.haa.pitt.edu/people/alison-langmead) and [Aaron Brenner](https://www.dsam.pitt.edu/people/aaron-brenner), who teach the DSAM Practicum (3100), will be joining us next week to get a preview of the projects you've been working on, which you are invited to continue – if you want – in that course. So as you start your presentations, be sure to...

1. recap what **question, problem, or puzzle** your project is responding to, and
2. state what **sources** you are processing and presenting.

That will help them see how your project moves you (and us) forward from where you started.


### Final presentations ≠ final reflections
... but both are coming soon.

**Next week**, we'll have our final class meeting, which will center on your final in-class presentations. The final portfolio will be due midway through the **following** week, on Wednesday, December 13, at 2pm. That timing allows you to include one last post-presentation iteration of your project; I'm also requiring a _reflective letter_ to me on the whole semester to open the portfolio. We'll talk more about the reflective letter and portfolio at the end of next week's class.

For next week's in-class presentation, I'm inviting you to pre-record a *10-minute* video. That's right, it's double the time!

One reason for the extra time is that we'll have guests, so you'll want to give a little more background than in the previous iteration, as mentioned above.

But another reason is that I'm now going to ask for a little more explicit reflection on <em>process</em>. Which brings us to...


### Reflective writing

As you head into one last group studio session, **please begin by thinking in writing** about the following questions, beginning with whichever produces the most heat for you right now:

1. What was your process for this iteration, e.g. what steps or strategies did you use to take the project forward? In particular, what did your Mindful Practice Journal show you about your process? See if you can _summarize your journal notes and draw conclusions from your experience._ What did this iteration demonstrate to you? What were the celebrations and the frustrations? What does that suggest to you for future iterations?

2. What sorts of _feedback_ from your peers and your instructor have you incorporated in this iteration? How has this feedback modified your process, if at all?

3. What were the ways that the technological _affordances and restrictions_ of each of your tools interacted with your source materials to produce something unique?

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you can incorporate answers to these questions smoothly into your presentation or your public-facing project (perhaps on a separate "Process" or "Reflections" page, perhaps in a GitHub README.md file), all the better!
</div>


## Studio time!
My hope is that by reflecting on your process notes and the feedback you've received, you'll write yourself into a clearer sense of your present goals and next steps.

<div class="alert alert-success">When you have a sense of what you'd like to achieve by the end of class or by next week, please write them into the shared google doc: <a href="https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes">bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes</a>. This helps with accountability – and helps me find where I can be most helpful during the studio time.</div>

Then get started on those goals, and call me over as needed!

<div class="alert alert-info"> Don't forget to save and commit (if you're using GitHub) and to log your time in your Mindful Practice Journal.</div>

## Exit note
When the end of the class is approaching, **please head back into the [google doc](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes)** and respond to your own note from earlier:
* How far did you get?
* What are your new priorities for the coming week?


<a id="hw"></a>
## Homework for Next Time

No new readings for next week! Instead, pour that extra time into your project's deliverable and a recorded presentation – now with a ten-minute run time.

- You should be done assembling material by now, and ideally moving from initial processing toward a more public presentation.
    * I readily acknowledge that 12 weeks (or even 14) is not a lot of time to complete such a cycle!
    * Even so: see if you can frame any incompleteness as _work in progress_. Can you signal your anticipated action plan, and where you are along the path of that plan?
    * Use the reflective questions above to help you find that plan.

- Post links to your deliverable and your presentation file (or the video itself, if GitHub lets you) on the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/).
    * In your presentation, be sure to open by briefly stating (1) what question, problem, or puzzle your project is responding to, and (2) what sources you have processed and will be presenting in response.
    * See if you can use the reflective questions above to help you discover and/or frame your key takeaways.


- Continue logging your time in a [Mindful Practice Journal](../projects#mindful-practice-journal) and (if you're using GitHub) in commit messages.

I won't require you to come to office hours, but you are certainly welcome to [sign up](../office) if you'd like! Or email me if that's easiest.
