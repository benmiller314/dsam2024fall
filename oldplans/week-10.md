<a id="preamble"></a>
## Preamble: Workshop + peer review plan

Welcome back to presentation day, take two! I'm excited to hear more about how it's been going, and especially for you all to hear how it's been going for everyone else.

### A workshop cycle reminder

I thought it worked fairly well last time, so let's stick with the cycle we used then, with each person getting about 15-20 minutes:

1. The first five minutes will be a live version (or playback, your call) of the **presentation** you've pre-recorded.
2. From there, the rest of us start by **saying back** what we see as the main questions (challenges, puzzles) or hypotheses (claims, solutions) being explored in the project, but with a **...?** added to the end, opening a space for the presenter to say more.
    - This kind of _active listening_ can often get us to the edge of our current thinking, testing out the almost-said implications of what feels right and what feels off.
3. That should set up a more organic back-and-forth **conversation** about the project. Anything is fair game here: tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process (including questions about sources, processing, or presentation platforms); comparisons with your own projects; etc.
4. At the 15-minute mark, we'll start looking for a stopping point and then take some quick private **notes**: what do we want to remember for our own future projects or presentations?  for our written peer review?

### Peer review guidelines
About that peer review: you'll each be responsible for **writing back to two of your classmates**. In those reviews, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

<details><summary>A reminder of how you can offer feedback even while you're still figuring stuff out for yourself (hint: by being a genuine, curious audience)</summary>
<ul>
    <li>Help them see how their work is coming across to you by summarizing back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing. (That last is often a good place to lean into.)</li>
    <li>Help them see how you've tried to engage with the project through its public-facing platform, and what it makes you think of: as in my suggestions for conversation above, this may include tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects; and so on.</li>
    <li>Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.</li>
</ul>
</details>

I've again split presentations in two sets of three, with peer reviews crossing from one set to the other, so you can pay extra attention to your assigned partner without having to worry that your own presentation is imminent.

Compared to last time, you'll have one same reviewer/reviewee and one new.

| This person | Presenting in slot | Writes to... | And also to... |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Alex        | 1                  | Khushboo     | Mustafa        |
| Reza        | 2                  | Mustafa      | Sidra          |
| Chloe       | 3                  | Sidra        | Khushboo       |
| Khushboo    | 4                  | Alex         | Reza           |
| Mustafa     | 5                  | Reza         | Chloe          |
| Sidra       | 6                  | Chloe        | Alex           |

(From the original setup, I swapped which trios went in the first half vs. second, then I rotated within each group so the same person wouldn't have to go first; then I used the same relative pointers to assign peer reviews, so that those ended up rotating by one person as well.)

<a id="first-half"></a>
## Presentations: first half

* Alex
* Reza
* Chloe

That process, again:
1. presentation,
2. saying back with **...?**,
3. conversation,
4. writing notes (while the next person sets up).


## Break (10 minutes)
We should hit the break at around 10:10 today.

<a id="second-half"></a>
## Presentations: second half

* Khushboo
* Mustafa
* Sidra

That process, one more time:
1. presentation,
2. saying back with **...?**,
3. conversation,
4. writing notes (while the next person sets up).


## EXT: Follow-ups to the project discussions

* If time and interest allows, we can talk about presentation-fu: slide deck strategies, scripting tips, etc.

* Or we can talk about what we've valued most in peer review, recognizing that it's easier to name positive things and ask for more of them than to ask for something different.

<a id="options"></a>
## Upcoming readings: people's choice

We've now reached the point in the semester where I had too many ideas, and I wasn't sure what you all would be interested in, so I wrote up four sets of readings for the next three weeks. Let's have a look at those three – plus, um, a fifth one I just added last night, and maybe a split of one of those – to see if we can agree on an order. If we can't muster enthusiasm for three of these, we can also try to find a new topic that I can put together a list of readings for: not to discuss next week, but the week after.

## EXT: Writing time: Work toward peer review letters

<a id="hw"></a>
## Homework for next time

* If you haven't yet posted a link to a public-facing deliverable, please do so ASAP: even if it's just the text of your presentation (I saw that several of you had scripts) or a folder with a CSV dataset and a README file, that will be helpful for your peer reviewers – and for your own later reflection.
    - I'd be happy to help you create a fresh GitHub repo if you need one.

* Once you're able to, please finish writing in response to your peers, as soon as you're able to.
    - See the <a href="week-06#peer-review-guidelines">notes from last time</a> for how I'm hoping these will work, but in brief:
        * Have a look through the public-facing version of the project.
        * Be a genuine and generous audience: help your partner see their work through your eyes. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?
    <p>You can post these notes as replies to the <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a> posts containing the videos and links to projects.</p>


In addition, please do **read** the cluster we agreed on for next week:
