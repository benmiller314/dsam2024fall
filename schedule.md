# Class-by-Class Schedule

*[Jump to latest lesson plan](#current)*
*For the in-class notes doc, go to [bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes).*

Assignments are listed (as HW) *on the day they are assigned*. Readings should be completed, if possible, <strong>by end-of-day Friday</strong><a href="#ftn1" class="ftnref" id="ftnref1" title="This early deadline is not my way of being mean; it's just that sometimes things will take longer than you expect, and I'd really like for you to be able to sleep, and for me to be able to look over your work in the morning before class. Those latter two things are the real priorities that the 'night before' policy is meant to achieve."><sup>[1]</sup></a>, so you can post to our <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions}}">discussion forum</a>. Exercises and presentations are due the following class meeting, unless otherwise specified, and given our early start time I recommend endeavoring to complete them *by 9pm the night before* at the latest.

You should in general also have access to all your work in class, so we can discuss and/or revise. Possible methods of access include [GitHub](https://github.com) (recommended), Pitt's [OneDrive](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/cloud-collaboration-box-and-onedrive) instance (next best thing), an external service like Dropbox, or flash drive.

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref1" id="ftn1">[1]</a> This early deadline is not my way of being mean; it's just that sometimes things will take longer than you expect, and I'd really like for you to be able to sleep, and for me to be able to look over your work in the morning before class. Those latter two things are the real priorities that the "night before" policy is meant to achieve. <a href="#ftnref1"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p>
