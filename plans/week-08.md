## First half: Discussion

### Warm-up writing
I want to start in a similar way to last time, by calling to mind some terms from this week's readings and videos that might help us think *across* texts and contexts in a useful way:

* metadata
* indexing
* plural(ism)
* un/semi/structured
* (non)scalable
* capta
* data settings
* explicit
* transparent
* iterative

Choosing one or two of these terms to begin unlocking the others, take about 5 minutes to gather some thoughts about how these ideas interact – and perhaps especially **ways you've seen these ideas or words used _in more than one_ of this week's texts** ([D'Ignazio and Klein on data pluralism](http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pitt-ebooks/detail.action?docID=6120950), [Schöch on big and smart data](https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/big-smart-clean-messy-data-in-the-humanities/), [Rawson & Muñoz on letting menus be messy](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/07154de9-4903-428e-9c61-7a92a6f22e51#ch23), or [Gradek and Monk on querying open data](https://vimeo.com/703773939). **What does putting these different uses together help you notice? What does it lead you to wonder? Where might we go from there?**


### Let's talk!

If we get to grok-writing by around 10:15, that should give us about equal time to dig into ideas now and then to dig into process in the second half.

And maybe we can take some collaborative notes at [bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes)?

<details><summary>Some possible moments to revisit, as needed:</summary>

<p>Lots of great intertextuality in the <a href="{{site.course.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion threads</a> this week!</p>

<ol class="spaced">
<li>Chloe pointed us to another version of the double-bind we were talking about last week, neatly tying several of these pieces together: we can't not impose an interpretation, but no interpretation can capture the entire phenomenon. Starting with the idea that "messy data has value and information in it and that data scientists should be trying to access that complexity," she notes (you, Chloe, note): <blockquote>Neither D'Ignzaio or Klein, or Rawson and Muñoz, argue that this process would be an easy one. But I felt that the Schöch piece helpfully illustrated why moving away from data cleaning (which again none of the authors are calling for but just for the sake of the argument) is so hard. To be able to draw conclusions from data and to use it to understand things, it has to be standardized to a certain degree. Schöch's piece emphasizes that data has to be big (large and varied) but also smart (semi-structured, limited varieties, and clean). To be able to extract information and be able to make decisions using data requires obscuring parts of that data; finding the balance is apparently a project data scientists need to constantly return to.</blockquote></li>

<li>Khushboo raised the question of privilege hazard and perceptions of legitimacy, connecting the ideas in both <em>Data Feminism</em> (D'Ignazio and Klein) and "Against Cleaning" (Rawson & Muñoz) to her independent project: <blockquote>Katie Rawson raises an important concern about the usage of the term “data cleaning” itself which privileges a normative order and rejects what is different. Thinking in terms of my own project, I wonder the legitimacy of data accumulation with respect to people who are documenting violence through clandestine or other “illegitimate” ways. This leads me to think about platforms where certain kinds of data enjoy more veracity or global reach as compared to other mediums, thus opening debates about hierarchization of data that privileges one constellation of events over others, one mode of documentation over the rest.</blockquote> I hear you saying, Khushboo, that in some rhetorical spaces the direct witness of people facing violence is less well received, or gets less circulation, than the witness of professional reporters or government figures. Yes, or...? (I feel like there's also more to what you're saying than that captures...)</li>

<li>In your post on the discussion forum, Sidra, you drew our attention to the ways "data" often reads as "this clinical, numbers-driven term that belongs in a realm of the humanities that I don't really participate in (or at least participate in well)" – but that Johanna Drucker's idea of "capta" gets you into a different position, more openly interpretive, perhaps more like the rest of humanist inquiry. Yes...?</li>

<li>Did anyone have a look at the <a href="https://nbviewer.org/gist/trevormunoz/8358810">Python scripts Trevor Muñoz posted</a> in the Works Cited of "Against Cleaning"?</li>

</ol>

### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?</p>
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which we'll all say, simply, "thank you."

<a href="week-03#an-explanation" class="smaller" title="We skipped this explanation in week 3, but it's there if you're curious">Why this terminology?</a>


## Break (10 minutes)
Assuming we left off at 10:30, let's aim to start up again at 10:40 or so. That should beat the elevator rush for 11am classes.


<a id="second-half"></a>
## Second half: Working with (Messy) <del>Data</del> <del>Capta</del> <ins>Materials</ins>

In the second half of today's class, I want to open up a space for you to raise questions about the projects you've been working on, both to get help thinking through or working through next steps and also to realize that you're almost certainly not the only one asking similar questions.

There's also an invitation, for those interested, to get hands-on with more data relevant to squirrels.

### Reflective Writing

But let's start with a quick mental inventory. You can make just a quick list for yourself, for now; you can always come back and expand it as needed. This can be private writing until you want to share.

1. When you think back to the work you've done on the project in the last couple of weeks, what stands out?
2. What are you proud of?
3. What are you wondering?

EXT: if you're waiting for your classmates, you might connect it to the week's readings:

<ol start="4"><li>To what extent does it help you to think of the material in your own project as <em>data</em>? As <em>capta</em>?</li>
<li>What does it help you see, do, or ask?</li>
<li>What does it hide or impede?</li>
</ol>

### Troubleshooting projects, together

Let's think about some of the things you're trying to do, but finding challenging. Can we quickly go around the room first to see if there are overlapping questions?


### Option: Working with Open Data

Gradek and Monk's video was part of the [InfoEco Cookbook](https://infoeco.hcommons.org/infoecocookbook), a series of open educational resources developed out of a seminar on Information Ecosystems (subtitled "Information, Power, and Consequences"). In addition to the video, there's a 10-15-minute exercise in figuring out which Pittsburgh neighborhood has the largest number of food-producing trees.

If you're not in a headspace to work on your project during class, or you just want to try your hand at the techniques in the video from homework, start here.

If possible, I recommend working with a partner: it's not always obvious which trees produce food, and talking it out can illustrate the kinds of decisions you'll have to make, and the kinds of disagreements you'll have to negotiate, whenever coding ambiguous data.

_Advanced level:_ Try to document the reasons you give for the trees you select, building a "data diary" you could later present as part of a guide or methods section.


### Option: Studio

If you're energized for your project and/or you've used pivot tables and open data before, go ahead and make progress on your work. Don't forget to save and commit (if you're using GitHub) and to log your time in your Mindful Practice Journal.

## Homework for Next Time

Upcoming DSAM-relevant event! Not required, but highly recommended:

* Antonio Byrd, "[Coding Black Functions for White Software Programs](https://calendar.pitt.edu/event/dr_antonio_byrd_coding_black_functions_for_white_software_programs)," Thursday, October 26, 5:00-6:30pm, 501CL. Dr. Byrd's talk is super-relevant to our topics for the last couple of weeks: he'll be presenting findings from focus-group interviews and participant-observation in a coding "bootcamp," noting the ways that the curricula and assessment practices largely center white end-users, and proposing an alternative vision. This is part of his book-in-progress called _The Literacy Pivot: How Black Adults Learn Computer Programming in a Racist World_.


By Friday, please **read**...

* Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton. “New Data?

**Continue** working on your projects, keeping track of time spent (on any relevant components, not just presentable products) in your Mindful Practice Journal.

And finally, please **write**: as usual, you'll find a [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions) for your 100-ish-word responses (excitements, incitements, enticements), which I'll look at while I prepare next week's lesson plan. Pointing us to a particular place in one of the readings (or videos) will be the most helpful, I expect. And if you were able to get them up by Friday (and I know it's not always possible), that's always ideal.
