# Week 2: (Getting Ready)
<span class="date">September 4, 2023</span>

<div class="alert alert-danger">Reminder: no synchronous class this week!</div>

Have a look at the discussion on the [issue queue]({{site.repo_url}}/issues/3), about the range of Digital Humanities projects (including minimal DH), and feel free to reply to each other if you'd like!

I (Ben) know many of you have already signed up to meet in [office hours](office) some time this week. I'll see you there! And if none of those times work, let's figure out something else by email.

## What to expect in those meetings

These first meetings are aimed not only at getting to know you a little better, but ideally to do so by **talking through possible digital projects for you to work on this semester.** That's why I chose the assignments I'd chosen for last week: they demonstrate a (partial) range of possible project formats, all of which neverthless can be productively framed as "sources, processed and presented" (in Posner's formulation), and all of which are (to borrow phrasing you'll soon read in Montfort) "tractable, computational, and interesting."

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>To prep for the meeting, then, I encourage you to consider these questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What questions do you have within your larger research agenda? What sources might help you gather evidence in pursuit of responses to those questions?</li>
    <li>What sources do you have within your grasp? What larger research questions do you have that these sources might help you address?</li>
    <li>Were there any projects you saw that made you say, "Zomg I want to learn how to do <em>that</em>"?</li>
</ol>
</div>

And if you don't see this in time, we'll think through it on the spot. :¬)

From those starting points, we'll then look for ways to keep the project at a viable scale, which will mean asking Risam and Gil's minimal computing questions:

4. What do we need?
5. What do we have?
6. What must we prioritize?
7. What are we willing to give up?

Planning on a small-scale deliverable from the outset and then adding stretch goals if they turn out to be easier than expected is a good way to keep your morale up and your learning visible.


## For week 3

When we get back together on September 11th, I'd like to continue our conversation about what "digital" affords by looking at executable _code_ as a quintessential digital affordance, and why it might be helpful to think of programming as a literate practice – including as a generative practice.

By Monday, **install** a plain-text editor (e.g. [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) if you don't already have one.

By Friday, **read**...

I've created a [new issue for this discussion]({{site.repo_url}}/issues/4), though you're certainly welcome to cross-reference if you want.

See you soon!
