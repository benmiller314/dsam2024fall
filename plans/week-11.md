## First half: Discussion

### Warm-up writing

What metadata have you worked with most extensively?

### Let's talk!

If we get to grok-writing by around 10:15, that should give us about equal time to dig into ideas now and then to dig into process in the second half.

And maybe we can take some collaborative notes at [bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes)?

<details open><summary>Some possible prompts for consideration / moments to revisit, as needed:</summary>

<ol class="spaced">
    <li><details><summary>Clearly they like to clarify</summary>
    <p>A few weeks ago, Chloe drew our attention to the idea of a <strong>data diary</strong>. What do you understand that term to mean? Do this week's readings give you any insight into why or how to build a data diary? (I wrote this question while reading the Dublin Core Usage Guide, for example.) Whom does it serve?</p>
    </details></li><!--/data guides and explicit guidance -->

    <li><details><summary>Can we fairly be "minimal" when dealing with human subjects?</summary>
    <p>Sidra <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/13#discussioncomment-7479965">raised</a> the challenge of following Jaffe's libguide advice to seek a "golden minimum" set of metadata to record. In both her own and Khushboo's projects, she points out that "one aspect of my struggle is constructing  inaccurate image of a person that I never knew, and that I can only ever know pieces of now that he is gone. Is there even a way to consider a minimum amount of information for such a situation? Or, should I conceive of the minimum in terms of what I am trying to convey about him?" Thoughts?</p>
    </details></li><!-- minimalism -->

    <li><details><summary>Setting rights to rights</summary>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/13#discussioncomment-7481774">Alex's post</a> dug into the thorny ethics of automatically captured metadata, especially around course management systems (CMSes). She writes: "This aspect of talking about the data at the level of description makes me think further about people as data points and how that will be captured again and folded into this snapshot of metadata. I wonder about how an institution might talk about where they collect data from its population, and to what extent those data collection practices might be regulated or not."</p>
    </details></li><!-- Alex's post -->

    <li><details><summary>Pre-arranged permission: the Creative Commons</summary>
    <p>Elsewhere in her post, Alex mentioned "CC and copyright standard uses," and perhaps that could be expanded. The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, an organization that <a href="https://creativecommons.org/mission/">promotes</a> "ethical, inclusive, and purposeful sharing that serves the public interest," offers six <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/">licenses</a> that limit copyright's default of "all rights reserved" – so you can reserve some rights but freely grant others. Should we talk about what that looks like in practice?</p>
    </details></li><!--/cc licenses -->

    <li><details><summary>Too much of a good thing?</summary>
    <p>In addition to seconding Alex's point about the ethical challenges of Big (meta)Data collection, Mustafa <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/13#discussioncomment-7483503">points</a> to the proliferation of metadata standards as shown in the glossary, and notes a paradox: "metadata is here to make it easy to get information, understand, or classify objects. When we have a lot of different standards, does it make the process harder rather than serving its functions?"</p>
    <p>Any thoughts on why we have so many standards? Any way to fix it?</p>
    <p>Here's <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">one take, from Randall Munroe</a>.</p>
    </details></li><!-- too many standards -->

    <li><details><summary>Search results and metadata</summary>
    <p>This one's maybe less of a thorny topic and more of a cool extension. Chloe read on to the chapter by Tony Gill, on "Metadata and the Web," and learned why Google can return a search result that, when you click on it, no longer exists. I'll let her tell it. :¬) <!--: it's because the engine is searching an index derived <em>from</em> the web, not the web itself. -->As Chloe <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/13#discussioncomment-7471744">writes</a>, this explanation "helps illuminate the black box of digital work a bit more," breaking down the magic. And that does, yes, set up our readings for next week, on the materiality of the digital. Thanks for the lookahead, Chloe!</p>
    </details></li>

### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?</p>
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which we'll all say, simply, "thank you."

<a href="week-03#an-explanation" class="smaller" title="We skipped this explanation in week 3, but it's there if you're curious">Why this terminology?</a>


## Break (10 minutes)
Assuming we left off at 10:30, let's aim to start up again at 10:40 or so. That should beat the elevator rush for 11am classes.

<p>After defining your project goals and working through the initial
planning stages, your next steps are to ask:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What type of material are you describing (e.g., images,
documents, mixed materials, etc.)?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is your audience, now and in the future? Who is going to be using these resources and how? What kind of experience are you trying to create (e.g., a timeline, a map, etc.)?</p></li>
<li><p>What data points are necessary to support that user experience? What data points are necessary to make your resources meaningful? Create metadata your wish list; find your golden minimum based on your project goals. What kind of information do you want to record?</p></li>
<li><p>Map your desired data points to appropriate <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/2005-08-15/elements/">Dublin Core elements</a>: Title, Subject, Description, Type, Source, Relation, Coverage, Creator, Publisher, Contributor, Rights, Date, Format, Identifier, Language. Note that some of these elements are allowed to repeat, and that you may have some data points that don’t map onto the Dublin Core 15.</p></li>
<li><p>For which metadata elements do you want make use of data value standards (e.g., controlled vocabulary terms, specific encoding or formats standards)? For which do you want to develop your own? For each of your golden minimum metadata elements, list anticipated/allowed values, indicating which elements are open-ended (e.g. free text).</p></li>
<li><p>Using your metadata template, create descriptive metadata records for each of the information objects in your project.</p></li>
</ol>

### Reflective writing / Goal setting
Before we all split off, though, take a moment to check in with yourself: do some private writing in response to these questions.

1. What keeps you coming back to your project? What makes it important, or exciting, for you to work on now?

2. Think about the state of your project as it stands now, and where you'd like to be by next class. Try to make **a list of the parts, steps, or or pieces** you want to accomplish. Try to be specific. e.g. Rather than "find sources," you might say, "search MediaCloud for news stories"; rather than "work on analysis," you might say, "take facet counts from OpenRefine and make a series of bar charts"; etc.

3. Look over your list, and **choose one thing you'd like to accomplish – or ask about – in class**. If you can't pick just one, choose a top three... and then pick one to start with.

<div class="alert alert-success">When you have a sense of your studio goals, please write them into the shared google doc: <a href="https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes">https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes</a></div>

## Go to!
Get started, and call me over as needed!

<div class="alert alert-info"> Don't forget to save and commit (if you're using GitHub) and to log your time in your Mindful Practice Journal.</div>

## Exit note
When the end of the class is approaching, **please head back into the google doc** and respond to your own note from earlier:
* How far did you get?
* What are your new priorities for the coming week?
