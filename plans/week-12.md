## First half: Discussion

### Warm-up writing
What was your favorite illustration in Ford or Crawford & Joler? (Or: what stands out in your memory?) Why?

<!-- ALT: How material was the new materialist chapter by Gries et al? -->


### Let's talk!

If we get to grok-writing by around 10:15, that should give us about equal time to dig into ideas now and then to dig into process in the second half.

And maybe we can take some collaborative notes at [bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes)?

<details open><summary>Some possible prompts for consideration / moments to revisit, as needed:</summary>

    <p>Sidra <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/14#discussioncomment-7547551">urged us</a> to look for "the people under the floors," connecting a passage in Crawford & Joler to "a semi-viral tumblr post that comes back every once and a while to keep me up at night and lead me to question my own place in the chain of actions and events discussed in the reading" – and I'm pretty sure, Sidra, you're not alone.</p>
    <p>Here's an excerpt from the post:</p>
    <blockquote><p>when she [an art history professor] excitedly detailed the ingenious roman invention of heated floors in bathhouses via hearths in small crawlspaces, we asked who was tending the fires. she said, "oh, slaves I suppose. but that isnt the point". and we said that it actually very much was the point. she had just told us that in roman society there were dozens of people, maybe hundreds, who spent every day of their enslaved lives crawling in cramped, hot, smoky tunnels to light fires to warm pools of water (which they were not allowed to swim in). how could that not be the point?</p> <p>she wanted us to focus on the art, on the innovation of heated plumbing, on the tiles and decorations of the bathhouses, and all we wanted to do was learn more about the people under the floors. and she didn't know anything more about that.</p></blockquote>
    <p>And here's the passage from <em>Anatomy of an AI</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>Many of the triangles shown on this map hide different stories of labor exploitation and inhumane working conditions. The ecological price of transformation of elements and income disparities is just one of the possible ways of representing a deep systemic inequality. We have both researched different forms of ‘black boxes’ understood as algorithmic processes, 18 but this map points to another form of opacity: the very processes of creating, training and operating a device like an Amazon Echo is itself a kind of black box, very hard to examine and track in toto given the multiple layers of contractors, distributors, and downstream logistical partners around the world. <strong>As Mark Graham writes, “contemporary capitalism conceals the histories and geographies of most commodities from consumers. Consumers are usually only able to see commodities in the here and now of time and space</strong>, and rarely have any opportunities to gaze backwards through the chains of production in order to gain knowledge about the sites of production, transformation, and distribution.”</blockquote>
    <p>Will this keep you up at night? Why? What can/should we do next?</p>

    <li><details><summary>The supposedly virtual reaches out into the world</summary>
    <p>Alex <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/14#discussioncomment-7547783">pointed us</a> toward the creeping horizon of surveillance by "smart" devices. You drew especially on <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/emails-show-amazon-rings-hold-lapd-through-camera-giveaways">research</a> by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> into the Los Angeles Police Department's close ties to the Ring doorbell-with-a-camera system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(company)#:~:text=it%20was%20acquired%20by%20amazon%20in%202018%20for%20over%20%241.2%20billion">now</a> owned by Amazon), but I followed some of the links from that article, which share additional stories of how Ring and affiliated apps enhance paranoia. (A fun holiday gift to yourself!)</p> <p>One conclusion I draw: the network effects of digital tools do not stay inside network diagrams, but have real effects on people – and not only the people who opt into the devices. What else do we take away, or want to pursue?</p>

    <li><details><summary>New tools, same paradigms?</summary>
    <p>Chloe <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2023fall/discussions/14#discussioncomment-7547896">noticed</a> an echo in this week's readings of an idea we've encountered a few times since day one of the semester (and here linked to <span title="'You, using a pen and paper, can do anything a computer can; you just can’t do those things billions of times per second.'">Ford</span>, Crawford and Joler, and also the Ruha Benjamin piece from week 4): "though it’s easy to think of the digital as an entirely separate world, but that idea doesn’t actually work all that well. Digital tools are incredibly powerful, but that power comes from a difference in speed and scale, rather than kind." Since that's the case, you raised the possibility that maybe all the hand-wringing about digital methods is a bit excessive: "Analytically, that to me suggests that we don’t really need to come up with new paradigms as scholars, but can make significant headway in analyzing digital projects using the techniques we already have." </p>
    <p>This stands in contrast to, say, Gries et al's argument that "The digital humanities is not simply the humanities plugged in, but the humanities seeking out a kind of seduction: to be drawn into new relations that will invariably produce unexpected outcomes" (89–90). In their view, "DH is not doing the same work differently; <em>it is different work done differently and with new partners</em>" (90, emphasis in original).</p>
    <p>How do we feel about it? What's gained from each perspective? Is the tension productive, or...?</p>
    </details>
    </li>
    <li><details><summary>A good question toward next time</summary>
    <p>In another part of Alex's post, they raised questions about AI in academia, especially "how ai will change academic labor when it comes to the publishing industry and tenure track positions." I'd love to unpack that more when we have a little extra reading on Large Language Models under our belts!</p>

### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?</p>
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which we'll all say, simply, "thank you."

<a href="week-03#an-explanation" class="smaller" title="We skipped this explanation in week 3, but it's there if you're curious">Why this terminology?</a>


## Break (10 minutes)
Assuming we left off at 10:30, let's aim to start up again at 10:40 or so. That should beat the elevator rush for 11am classes.

## Second half: Hands on

Today will be mostly studio! I do encourage you all to start with some writing time first, though. I'll do the same with one of my own projects.

### Reflective writing / Goal setting
Do some private writing in response to the following questions before you split off:

1. I've previously asked what makes your project important, or exciting. Without losing that, I want you to consider: what makes it hard? Where have your stuckpoints been over the last week or two? **See if you can describe the difficulty in a new way, perhaps as a metaphor or simile.** Sometimes a new formulation can give you a new way forward – or a new question to ask.

2. Think about the state of your project as it stands now, and where you'd like to be by next class. Try to make **a list of the parts, steps, or or pieces** you want to accomplish. Try to be specific. e.g. Rather than "find sources," you might say, "search MediaCloud for news stories"; rather than "work on analysis," you might say, "take facet counts from OpenRefine and make a series of bar charts"; etc.

3. Look over your list, and **choose one thing you'd like to accomplish – or ask about – in class**. If you can't pick just one, choose a top three... and then pick one to start with.

<div class="alert alert-success">When you have a sense of your studio goals, please write them into the shared google doc: <a href="https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes">https://bit.ly/dsam2023fall-notes</a></div>

## Go to!
Get started, and call me over as needed!

<div class="alert alert-info"> Don't forget to save and commit (if you're using GitHub) and to log your time in your Mindful Practice Journal.</div>

## Exit note
When the end of the class is approaching, **please head back into the google doc** and respond to your own note from earlier:
* How far did you get?
* What are your new priorities for the coming week?
